**Thoughts**
 * While the challenge and my goal is to improve my ML knowledge, skills, and abilities, I'm also going to need to learn how to be more efficient with Jupyter Lab, Git, and GitHub.
 * The Andrew Ng course is off to a good start.  One of my goals for the next few days is to reach out in the discussion boards to start or join conversations with others in the class.
