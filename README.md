## Day 0: 2016-07-06

**Today's Goals**

 * Accept the challenge - Done
 * Create GitHub Repository for daily log - Done
 * Identify one ML course to complete. - Done
 * Identify potenital projects.  - In progress.  Self-imposed deadline for choosing a project, 2018-07-21.  

**Thoughts:** The first course for my 100 day challenge is Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning.  Looking forward to the next 100 days!


## Day 1: 2016-07-07

**Today's Goals**
 * Enroll and start Coursera Machine Learning course - Done

**Thoughts**
 * While the challenge and my goal is to improve my ML knowledge, skills, and abilities, I'm also going to need to learn how to be more efficient with Jupyter Lab, Git, and GitHub.
 * The Andrew Ng course is off to a good start.  One of my goals for the next few days is to reach out in the discussion boards to start or join conversations with others in the class.


## Day 2: 2016-07-08

**Today's Goals**
 * Complete Week 1 Introduction and Review sections - Done
 * Start Model and Cost Function section - Postponed
 * Type notes from Day 1 and Day 2 - Day 1 done, need to finish day 2
 * Spend time in Discussion Boards - Started, on-going

**Thoughts**
 * The course is going well, however it appears to require using another language for assignments, Octave.  I'm wondering if this is a language primarily used in academic environments or if there are companies that need Octave programmers.  Most of the job postings I've seen are looking for Python and/or R.
